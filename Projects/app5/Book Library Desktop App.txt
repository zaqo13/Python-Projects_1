we can add multiple books info one by one

info stored- Title, Year, Auther, ISBN, etc

Additional widget- Interactive Dictionary- 
		   	Here we can search the meaning of any word present in data.json file, given in folder


Module used- tkinter, sqlite3, json, difflib, etc

key point- same app with Object Oriented Programming style and without OOP style
	   Class, Inheritance, etc

Note- After installing the app, one .db file is generated, if you delete that file all your books info will gone.
	So make sure that you back-up that .db file.


Still there are many improvements....

If there are any suggestion?

Until next time....
